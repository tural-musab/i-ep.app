# Domain Consolidation Complete

✅ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Professional SaaS Domain Architecture

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dynamic BASE_URL System

- Single `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable
- Dynamic generation: localhost:3000 (dev) → staging.i-ep.app (staging) → i-ep.app (production)
- Replaced 5 separate URL variables with unified approach

### 2. Enterprise CI/CD Pipeline

- **staging.yml**: Develop branch → staging.i-ep.app deployment
- **production.yml**: Main branch → i-ep.app deployment
- **Supabase CLI Integration**: Automatic database migrations
- **Build Artifact Optimization**: Prebuilt deployments for speed

### 3. Multi-Domain CORS Support

- Dynamic allowed origins based on BASE_URL
- Subdomain support (demo.i-ep.app, staging.i-ep.app)
- Development environment compatibility

### 4. Professional Configuration

- NextAuth dynamic URL configuration
- Supabase cookie domain optimization
- Environment variable consolidation
- TypeScript strict compliance

## Results

- ✅ Clean environment variable management
- ✅ Professional staging/production workflows
