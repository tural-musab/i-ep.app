- Manual Vercel deployment may be required if CI fails

## 🧪 Testing Required After Deployment

### Safari Compatibility Testing
- [ ] **Chrome**: Verify blank page issue resolved
- [ ] **Safari 14+**: Test JavaScript execution and UI rendering
- [ ] **Safari 16+**: Validate modern feature compatibility
- [ ] **Mobile Safari**: iOS device testing recommended

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Authentication**: Login/logout workflows
- [ ] **Role-based Navigation**: Admin, teacher, student, parent routes
- [ ] **Component Rendering**: Assignment, attendance, grade dashboards
- [ ] **API Integration**: Backend connectivity verification
